<h1>UltraEdit Website Clone</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This is a clone of the <b>UltraEdit</b> download page, a popular text editor and hex editor, originally developed by Ian D. Mead in 1994 and acquired by Idera Inc. in August 2021. UltraEdit is widely used across multiple platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. This project was developed purely for educational purposes, aimed at enhancing my knowledge and skills in front-end web development. I do not intend to monetize this clone, and full credits go to UltraEdit and its developers.</p>

<h2>About UltraEdit</h2>
<p>UltraEdit is designed with software engineers in mind, supporting programming languages and workflows from basic text editing to advanced development environments. It is a <b>trialware</b> application, available for a limited free trial before purchase. You can find more about UltraEdit on its official <a href="https://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/ultraedit-download-thank-you/">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Features of This Clone</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>HTML & CSS Only</b>: The entire clone is built using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> only. No JavaScript was used in this project, which allowed me to explore CSS-based solutions for common web functionalities.</li>
    <li><b>CSS-Only Interactions</b>: By avoiding JavaScript, I was able to implement user interactions such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Click event handling with the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Hover effects for interactive feedback using CSS pseudo-classes like <code>:hover</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>File Download Buttons</b>: Users can click buttons to simulate file downloads, mimicking the original website's functionality. (Note: actual downloads are not functional as this is for educational purposes only).</li>
    <li><b>Minimalistic Design</b>: Clean and simple design focusing on the functionality and layout.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>As this project was created without JavaScript, some features present in the original UltraEdit site—such as dynamic input forms, animations, and more advanced user interactions—are <b>not functional</b>.</li>
    <li>Since this is my first web development project, there may be areas where the code structure could be improved, or additional features could be implemented.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>HTML5</b>: For the website structure and content organization.</li>
    <li><b>CSS3</b>: For the visual styling, layout, and hover effects.</li>
    <li><b>Details & Summary Tag</b>: Used to create expandable sections without the need for JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features Highlighted</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>CSS Hover Effects</b>: Implemented smooth hover transitions to improve user experience.</li>
    <li><b>Download Buttons</b>: Styled buttons that simulate downloading files from the page.</li>
    <li><b>Minimalistic Design</b>: Focused on a clean structure using HTML and CSS alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>No JavaScript</b>: Dynamic features such as form input handling and validation are not available.</li>
    <li><b>Browser Compatibility</b>: While the site is tested on modern browsers, there may be minor inconsistencies in older browsers.</li>
    <li><b>Structure</b>: As a beginner, the site’s code might not fully follow the best coding practices for large-scale or professional projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>I am <b>Ankit Roy</b>, a student at <b>Jadavpur University</b>, currently pursuing a degree in <b>Information Technology</b> (Class of 2028). This UltraEdit clone is my first project in web development, created after just 4 weeks of learning <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. I wanted to challenge myself to replicate a well-known website without relying on JavaScript and focus on fundamental design and functionality using CSS.</p>
<p>This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I look forward to further enhancing my skills in front-end and back-end development.</p>
